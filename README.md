## 🚀 About

Launchpad is a python framework built around discord.py that enables you
to easily create a modular discord bot along with an API, which should make
it easier to introduce a web dashboard later on.

We created this framework, because we often duplicated "loader" code across
our discord bot projects, and it has become an endeavour to maintain them
all.
